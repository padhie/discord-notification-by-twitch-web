; coverage  Enables Code Coverage Analysis to generate code coverage reports, mainly in combination with PHPUnit.
; debug     Enables Step Debugging. This can be used to step through your code while it is running, and analyse values of variables.
; gcstats   Enables Garbage Collection Statistics to collect statistics about PHP's Garbage Collection Mechanism.
; profile   Enables Profiling, with which you can analyse performance bottlenecks with tools like KCacheGrind.
; trace     Enables the Function Trace feature, which allows you record every function call, including arguments, variable assignment, and return value that is made during a request to a file.
